1. For the following example of resolving some Ticket Issues we must first login to our osTicket browser and check what problems our users may be experiencing.

2. In this example, the severity of the issue is that of an emergency, seeing that users are reporting that online banking is down due to a 404 browsing error. So I would assign this ticket to one of my System Administrators so for this example it is "Jane Doe" and set the "Priority" to "Emergency" in the "System Administrators" Department and set the "SLA" to "SEV-A" since we need this problem resolved as soon as possible.

3. Some tickets are low severity and can be resolved right away such as the following example the user just has a question and so I reply with a feedback and set the "Priority" to "Low" and "SLA" to "SEV-C" then set the the ticket to "Resolved" at the bottom of the page above "Reply".
